      <h5>Story</h5>
      <p>The last great war is a glorious memory for the Moniyans. The powerful Light's Order, together with the Imperial Border Guards, wiped out the demonic strongholds at the Moniyan and the Barren Lands pass, driving the fiends back to the hinterlands of the Forsaken Wastes. But for young Alucard, the war was nothing but a terrible memory of pain and misery. His father's second regiment suffered heavy losses due to a rash lone advance. Alucard's father disappeared in the battle, and was later declared dead by the Light's Order.</p>
